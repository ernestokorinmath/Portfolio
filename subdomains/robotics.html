                I'm a member of Ten80 Racing club since 2022.<br>
                I participated in almost a dozen Ten80 competitions, most of them as an Enterprise presenter organization planning and giving 3 minute fever pitches to judges. 
                This year I am taking the role as coach and leading the new younger kids, but during 2024 my 5 minute pitch at nationals, together with the successful racing competition, led to Ramtech59 becoming Ten80 National champions.

                I was member of the club in 9th and 10th grades, and President of the club in 11th grade, teaching 2 programming lessons a week in Python/Java. 
                I've competed in several hackathons and seasonal competitions like Riders Robotics , getting 2nd place at the world championship in 2022, and 6th place at Nationals in 2023 Qualifying for worlds.

                Teacher - coding and 3D design classes to Kenyaâ€™s students.<br>
                I've been teaching primarily CAD lessons along with some coding lessons to students from the city of Kisumu in Kenya through google meets on Saturdays. 
                This involves planning lessons and projects, then leading the students step by step through the process.

                    <summary>Internship at Earth Robotics</summary>
                    Over the summer of 2024, I was an Intern at <a href="https://www.earthrobotics.co/">Earth Robotics</a> through SYIP.  Position: Neural Network architect.<br>
                    I had various projects, the main one being a PyTorch neural network
                    that can classify numbers in the MNIST dataset. My other projects also heavily robotics
                    focused, one of which was 2D drive simulator for swerve robot drivetrains using mainly PyMunk
                    and PyGame. In addition to this I did other things in the realm of computer vision with OpenCV,
                    Ultralytics YOLO, and MediaPipe for projects such as pose estimation, object counting in the
                    case of humans passing a line on the screen, and a program that recognizes the direction that
                    somebody is looking at and the tilt of the face. I took the opportunity as well at the internship to
                    learn C++ in the context of Gazebo for future usage, which has now come in handy as I am
                    dissecting gazebo code and translating it to Java for the RRT*FND pathfinding algorithm. In
                    addition to this we were provided with Lidar technology, and learned how to process Point
                    Clouds with VeloView.

                    I participated for two years (2023 and 2024) as a counselor on <a href="https://www.ramtech59.com/summer-camp-19/">Ramtech Summer Camp</a>, helping kids build various types of robots and taught them many things related to robotics.
